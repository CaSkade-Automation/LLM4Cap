Distillation is a capability representing a simple distillation process with one input product called "liquidMixture". This mixture consists of two liquids and is defined by four properties. These properties are the boiling point and mass for each of the two liquids. The capability produces two outputs: distillate and residue. Both are also defined by their boiling point and mass. Boiling point and mass of each of the two liquids in the input mixture are constant values.
The following constraints apply: The boiling points of the two liquids in the input mixture must not be equal. And on the output side, the boiling point of the distillate is lower than the one of the residue. Furthermore, conservation of mass applies, i.e. the sum of the masses of the two input liquids in the mix must be equal to the sum of the masses of residue and distillate.

There is a coffeemaking capability that takes two products "coffeeBeans" and "water" as input. In addition the capability takes an information "typeOfCoffe" (e.g., Americano, Espresso) as input. The capability returns two products "coffee" and "coffeeGrounds" as output. The input "water" has a property temperature, which is measured in degrees Celsius (Â°C) and must be >= 0 and <= 50 as requirements and is freely selectable. The input "typeOfCoffee" has a property that determines the desired type of coffee, which is freely selectable. Likewise, the output "coffee" has a property that returns the type of coffee as an assurance, which must be equal to the desired type of coffee from the input "typeOfCoffee". In addition, the output "coffee" has a property temperature that must be >= 90 as an assurance.
